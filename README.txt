1.
The data we were working with was collected from the women of an Indian stem called “Pima”. It is a
data set for machine learning projects on classification. It contains several medical
attributes - such as blood pressure level - for each woman. One woman is described by one data row.
In total we have 768 data points. We have one binary variable which describes whether this woman
has diabetes or not. The data was collected because among Indian pima women a lot of them tend to
have diabetes. Now it’s about to find out why is that.

2.
The used data was collected from Kaggle, it is available under the following link:

In our repository (https://github.com/klujber/diabetes/) you can find the following files:

Our database:
	-diabetes.csv
Our plan with time schedule and detailled information to understand the database:
	-M3_report.pdf
The analysis has been made in Python in Jupyter Notebook, as well as in R Session.
	-the Python code: DiabatesSet.ipnyb
	-the R code with detailled infromation: R_Session_Diabetes_markdown.pdf
	-the R plots: PlotsR.pdf
	-the R Session code: R_Session_Diabetes_markdown.Rmd
The statistically significant plots are available also in high resolution:
